# Propensity Modeling for an E-Commerce Company

This client is an emerging e-commerce startup that offers a wide range of products, from daily essentials like dairy and vegetables to high-end electronics and home appliances. Despite a growing number of visitors exploring their platform, only a small fraction actually makes a purchase.

To boost sales without depleting their limited marketing budget, the company plans to send targeted discounts or coupons to users who are more likely to make a purchase. As a trusted partner, we are tasked with building a propensity model to predict the likelihood of individual users buying a product. This predictive model will enable the company to identify and target users with the highest purchase probabilities, ensuring a more efficient and cost-effective marketing campaign.
